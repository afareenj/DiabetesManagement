  <h5>Importance of Testing Foot Neuropathy</h5>
  <p>Neuropathy is the loss of sensation of pain or touch, and for patients with diabetes, can result in diabetic foot.
    Keep feet in good hygiene by washing the feet daily in warm water using mild soap while avoiding soaking feet.
    Dry feet carefully and gently, especially between toes. Use moisturizing lotion at least once daily, avoiding area between the toes.
  </p>
  <p>Always wear protective footwear, and never go barefoot. Be aware of swelling of feet, redness or discoloration.
    Trim nails straight across and file sharp corners to match shape of toe. If nails are thickened or deformed, seek treatment because they may have been infected.
