  <p>Diabetes is a group of conditions that result in too much sugar (glucose) in the blood, usually associated with insulin, a hormone that normally controls blood glucose levels.</p>
  <h6>Type I:</h6> <p>Type I diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes, is an autoimmune condition that usually first presents during childhood. It is usually caused by the body’s own immune system attacking the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, causing little-to-no insulin to be produced. </p>
  <h6>Type II:</h6><p>Type II diabetes is a far more common type of the disease, in which the body produces some insulin, but this amount is either not enough for the body’s needs or the body’s cells are resistant to the insulin. This is called insulin resistance, or lack of sensitivity to insulin.</p>
