  <h5>Instructions</h5>
  <p>Long-acting insulin (Lantus) only needs to be injected once or twice daily. Insulin glargine works for 24 hours.</p>
  <p>Regular prandial insulin (Humulin) should be injected 30 minutes before meals.</p>
  <p>Rapid acting insulin (Novolog, Humalog) may be injected before or after eating. Dosage may vary depending on amount of food eaten because rapid insulin is given after meals.</p>
  <p>Insulin dosage should be reduced when fasting for surgery, when not eating, or when hypoglycemia occurs. Illness or infection may increase insulin requirements.</p>
  <h5>Technique</h5>
  <p>It is import to insert the needle perpendicular to the skin. This ensures deep subcutaneous administration of insulin.</p>
  <h5>Dosage</h5>
  <p>Dosage may be adjusted based on the actual amount of food ingested for fast acting insulin.</p>
  <p>For every 10-15 grams of carbohydrates consumed, use one unit of insulin dosage.</p>
  <p>Example: If the food has 100g of carbohydrates, and 20g of dietary fiber, that would be approximately 100-20/2 = 90g total, which would be 9 units of insulin.</p>
