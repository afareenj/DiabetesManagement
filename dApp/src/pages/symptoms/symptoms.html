  <h3>Blood Glucose</h3>
  <h5>We recommend three daily meals and an evening snack. Assess blood glucose level before meals and at bedtime</h5>
  <h5>A diet low in fat and high in fiber helps to control cholesterol and triglycerides. Refined and simple sugars should be reduced, and complex carbohydrates, such as cereals and rice should be increased.</h5>
  <h3>Signs of High Blood Glucose Levels (Hyperglycemia)</h3>
  <h5>If you experience the following symptoms you should check blood glucose level:</h5>
  <p>Increased thirst</p>
  <p>Hunger</p>
  <p>Increased Urination</p>
  <p>Fatigue</p>
  <p>Blurred vision</p>
  <h3>Signs of Low Blood Glucose Levels (Hypoglycemia)</h3>
  <h5>If you experience the following symptoms you should check blood glucose level:</h5>
  <p>Anxiety</p>
  <p>Tremors</p>
  <p>Slurred speech</p>
  <p>Fast heart rate (tachycardia)</p>
  <p>Excessive sweating (diaphoresis)</p>
  <p>Dizziness</p>
  <p>Headache</p>
  <p>Fatigue</p>
  <p>Hypoglycemia can be treated by eating a carbohydrate snack. It can also be treated with 50% dextrose or glucagon if unconscious.</p>
  <h3>Other Symptoms</h3>
  <h5>Hypertension</h5>
  <p>Hypertension is commonly associated with diabetes. Control of blood pressure prevents coronary artery disease, stroke, retinopathy and nephropathy.</p>
  <h5>Peripheral Neuropathy</h5>
  <p>This is the loss of sensation in the extremeties. Avoid heating pads and always wear shoes when walking to prevent injury.</p>
  <h5>Renal Failure</h5>
  <p>Monitor urine albumin and serum creatinine. More than 1.5 mg/dL of creatinine implies renal failure. Microalbuminuria is the first sign of diabetic nephropathy.</p>
  <h5>Autonomic Neuropathy</h5>
  <p>Check integrity of your skin. Skin breakdown can lead to infection. Neuropathy causes decreased sweating, causing excessive dryness and skin breakage, and can also result in loss of motor reflexes and swelling in foot.</p>
  <h5>Infections</h5>
  <p>Check nails. Diabetes increases risk of infection because of impaired immunity. Fungal infections in nails can lead to bacterial infections. Patients with thickened or deformed nails should seek treatment from a medical professional.</p>
  <p>Neuropathy causes sensation of pain and tenderness, which can lead to infection, and even amputation. Look for redness, drainage, and swelling.</p>
  <h5>Swelling or Inflammation (Edema)</h5>
  <p>Edema can cause ulceration (open sore or wound on the skin).</p>
